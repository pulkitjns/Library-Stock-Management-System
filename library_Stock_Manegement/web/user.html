 <p>Libraries enables and encourages access for everyone to unbiased information, knowledge and works of imagination:<br>

providing opportunities and support for formal and informal learning
providing and promoting timely, accurate and useful information
promoting the enjoyment of reading
contributing to enjoyment and quality of life
encouraging participation in cultural, democratic and economic activities
contributing to the development of healthy, caring and socially inclusive communities
Through a published Library Stock Management Policy, Shropshire Libraries aims to:</p>
 <p>
select and provide such material as will meet the library requirements of the community
maximise the use of limited resources by ensuring every item of stock justifies its place in the library, and that stock is promoted and exploited in such a way that it is used to its full potential
promote a unified approach to the selection and development of stock countywide according to the aims and objectives of the library service.
More specifically, these aims are met by:
 </p>
 <p>
providing a wide range of popular material to meet the leisure needs of the community, reflecting tastes, interests, age groups, language and reading ability
providing material in alternative formats such as large print and talking books
acquiring material to support the educational requirements of the community in all aspects of popular learning and study
providing up to date accurate reference material to meet the information requirements of the community
recognizing readers’ changing needs for books and other material through customer comments, issues, library use, requests, outreach contacts, media and other communication channels
supplying and promoting material to attract a wider and more varied readership to our libraries
providing material that will reflect and support the social, economic and cultural aspirations of all sections of the community
providing material that will promote and support race equality and an understanding of cultural diversity
developing a training programme for staff in stock management
evaluating the performance of stock.</p>
